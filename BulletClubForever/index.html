    <h1>bullet club forever</h1>
    <p>A game written in JavaScript using the <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> framework.</p>
    <div id="game"></div>
    <br />
    <p>Controls: Left (Cursor Left), Right (Cursor Right), Jump (Spacebar)</p>
    <p>
        <span class="date">18/09/2014</span><br />
        We have movement! And it is the worst platform game movement ever. This is going to need some work...

        Grass foreground sprite that overlapped the player sprite's feet has gone :'(  Next up, controls! Or more probably, trying
        to organise everything into classes a bit more since I got JS intellisense in VS Express

        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25855938/javascript-intellisense-in-visual-studio-only-partially-working">working</a>. But then, definitely controls...

        I'm going to start trying to document my progress here in the hope that this will somehow mean that I don't abandon this
        after two weeks like I have all my other games I've tried to make. So far I've got a randomised level map which is infinitely less clever
        than Spelunky's but I guess inifinitely less clever than perfection isn't that bad. The map is created by
        <a href="https://github.com/johndarv/BulletClubForever/blob/master/BulletClubForever/GameScripts/LevelMap.js">this</a>
        class which also has the capability of adding to itself as the player progresses through the level. I mean to make this
        a bit clevererer by having the array recycle itself instead of just getting bigger and bigger. The game does have the word
        forever in the title after all.</p>
    <p>
        Phaser draws sprites/groups in the order that they're added to the game, so I managed to make the grass appear in front
        of the player, but I think I'm going to abaondon clever draw orders for now and concentrate on getting the basics in place.
        In case you hadn't noticed, it's not a game yet rather than a highly complex way of drawing pictures on a web page
        that took ages.
