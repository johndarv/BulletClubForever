    <h1>bullet club forever</h1>
    <p>A game written in JavaScript using the <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> framework.</p>
    <div id="game"></div>
    <br />
    <p>Controls: Left (Cursor Left), Right (Cursor Right), Jump (X)</p>

        There are many options for minifying and concatting js files. Currently I'm using a tool called <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html">jsmin</a>
        in combination with a build step in my VS project that does both steps. It looks like this: "type "$(ProjectDir)GameScripts\*.js" | "$(ProjectDir)Tools\jsmin.exe" > "$(ProjectDir)GameScripts\bcf.min.js"".
        It works well, as long as I have used semicolons properly across all files. I was recently made aware of
        <a href="www.">Google's Javascript standards</a> and the part about when to use semicolons and the difference
        between function declarations and function expressions explained why my concatted and minified file wasn't valid javascript at first.
        So now I have a minified file that contains all my game code. The index.html page uses this, whereas the debug.html
        page uses the originals for debugging purposes. There may well be a nicer way of doing this, but it will serve for now.

        Movement has been vastly improved. Had to do some fiddling to get the player to only collide with the
        platforms when landing on top of them, and not when colliding with them at the side or when jumping up through them, and it
        seems to work quite nicely. Have seen a bug where you can fall through the ground, but only once :) so not worrying about
        that for now. Next up I think I need to figure out how to do concatting and minifying of js files.

        We have movement! And it is the worst platform game movement ever. This is going to need some work...

        Grass foreground sprite that overlapped the player sprite's feet has gone :'(  Next up, controls! Or more probably, trying
        to organise everything into classes a bit more since I got JS intellisense in VS Express

        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25855938/javascript-intellisense-in-visual-studio-only-partially-working">working</a>. But then, definitely controls...

        I'm going to start trying to document my progress here in the hope that this will somehow mean that I don't abandon this
        like I almost certainly will. So far I've got a randomised level map which is infinitely less clever
        than Spelunky's but I guess inifinitely less clever than perfection isn't that bad. The map is created by
        <a href="https://github.com/johndarv/BulletClubForever/blob/master/BulletClubForever/GameScripts/LevelMap.js">this</a>
        class which also has the capability of adding to itself as the player progresses through the level. I mean to make this
        a bit clevererer by having the array recycle itself instead of just getting bigger and bigger. The game does have the word
        forever in the title after all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Phaser draws sprites/groups in the order that they're added to the game, so I managed to make the grass appear in front
        of the player, but I think I'm going to abaondon clever draw orders for now and concentrate on getting the basics in place.
        In case you hadn't noticed, it's not a game yet rather than a highly complex way of drawing pictures on a web page
        that took ages.
